    on this section, pick an exclusion to triage, then:
    - If it is a false positive, add a @SuppressFBWarnings(value = "[…]", justification = "[…]")
      annotation indicating the reason why it is a false positive, then remove the exclusion from
      this section.
    - If it is not a false positive, fix the bug, then remove the exclusion from this section.
